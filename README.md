# 🧠 Java Training Hub – Problem Solving Sheets (1 to ∞)

🚀 A comprehensive and ever-growing repository for mastering Java programming through structured **problem-solving sheets** and backend-focused exercises.  
This is part of my continuous journey to become a highly capable **Backend Java Developer**, building strong mental foundations in:

- Java Syntax & Core Principles  
- OOP & Design Patterns  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Multithreading & Concurrency  
- Clean Code, SOLID, and Software Craftsmanship  

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository is structured into a series of progressive **Java Problem Solving Sheets**, starting from basic syntax and gradually advancing toward complex backend logic and real-world systems.

Each problem is solved using **clean, modular, testable Java code**, written in a way that promotes **deep understanding, reusability**, and **engineering discipline**.

> 🧠 Think of each sheet as a level in your mental gym – and the gym never closes.

---

## 🚀 Topics & Skills Covered

- ✅ **Basic Syntax & Variables** – Java fundamentals, data types, operators  
- ✅ **Control Flow** – `if/else`, loops, switch-case  
- ✅ **Functions & Recursion** – Modular programming and recursive strategies  
- ✅ **Arrays & Data Structures** – Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Sets  
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
- ✅ **Design Patterns** – Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and more  
- ✅ **Exception Handling** – Robust error management & custom exceptions  
- ✅ **Algorithms** – Searching, Sorting, Problem Solving  
- ✅ **Multithreading** – Concurrency models and real-world thread use  
- ✅ **Clean Code & SOLID Principles** – Write for humans, not just machines  
- ✅ **Modularization** – Reusable components with separation of concerns

## 📁 Folder Structure

The structure is open-ended and infinitely extensible:

src/
├─ sheet1/
│ ├─ Sh1Pr1.java
│ ├─ Sh1Pr2.java
│ └─ ...
├─ sheet2/
│ └─ ...
└─ sheetN/

Each sheet includes:

- 📄 **Well-named Java classes** (e.g., `Sh5Pr2.java`)  
- 🧠 **Inline problem descriptions** where applicable  
- 🧪 **Testable & clean implementations** with modular design  
- 🧱 Built to reflect **real backend workflows** and encourage scalability

> ♾️ The sheet count keeps growing as learning continues.

- ✨ **Data Structures from Scratch** – Linked Lists, Trees, HashMaps  
- ✨ **Multithreading Challenges** – Runnable, Threads, Sync  
- ✨ **File Handling & Stream APIs**  
- ✨ **JUnit & Integration Testing**  
- ✨ **Mini Backend Systems** – CLI projects, service layers, modular logic  
- ✨ **Controller-based Architecture** – Preparing for scalable backend design

> 🎯 **Goal:** Build the mindset and codebase of a real software engineer — not just a student.

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehab-elshimi-developer/java-problem-solving-sheets.git
```
### 2. Open in Your Preferred Java IDE  
💡 **Recommended**: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with **Java Extension Pack**

---

### 3. Explore & Run  
This repository follows a **modular, auto-scalable structure** powered by `Generator.java`.

Each set of problems is organized into folders:

```
src/
 ├─ sheet1/
 │   ├─ Sh1Pr1.java
 │   ├─ Sh1Pr2.java
 │   └─ ...
 ├─ sheet2/
 │   └─ ...
 └─ ...
```

✅ **Naming Convention**  
`ShXPrY.java` → where `X = sheet number`, `Y = problem number`

---

### 🔁 Run a Specific Problem  
Update `Main.java`:

```java
runProblem(6, 4); // Executes sheet6.Sh6Pr4
```

---

### 🔄 Run a Full Sheet  

```java
testGeneratedSheet(6); // Executes Sh6Pr1 to Sh6Pr10
```

🧪 **Reflection** is used to dynamically load and invoke the `.run()` method of each class.

---

### ⚙️ Use the Generator  
Run `Generator.java` to:

- 🔍 Detect the latest existing sheet  
- 🆕 Create the next sheet automatically (e.g., `sheet7/`)  
- 🧱 Generate files like `Sh7Pr1.java` to `Sh7Pr6.java`  
- 🛠️ Update `Main.java` for immediate execution  

🧭 Whether you're starting with syntax or diving into algorithms — just generate and go.
